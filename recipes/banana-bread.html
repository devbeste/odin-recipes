            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.</li>
